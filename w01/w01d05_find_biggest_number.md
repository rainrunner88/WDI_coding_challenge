# Find Biggest Number (Elena Peng)

####TODO: Create a function that takes a positive integer number and returns the next bigger number formed by the same digits:

ex) nextBigger(12)==21

    nextBigger(513)==531

    nextBigger(2017)==2071

    If no bigger number can be composed using those digits, return -1:

    nextBigger(9)==-1

    nextBigger(111)==-1
    
    nextBigger(531)==-1
